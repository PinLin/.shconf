# .shconf

This is my shell configuration.

## Requirements

for `macOS`:

```sh
brew install zsh wget curl git vim
```

for `Debian` and `Ubuntu`:

```sh
sudo apt install zsh wget curl git vim
```

## Install

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PinLin/.shconf/master/install.sh | zsh
```
> You need to exit `zsh` when `oh-my-zsh` installed.

Download and install the font-type file in [`font`](https://github.com/PinLin/.shconf/master/font) directory.
